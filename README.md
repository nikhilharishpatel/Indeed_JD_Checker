# Indeed JD Checker
Check JDs on Indeed for trivial keywords like Sponsorship/Citizen or your favorite technology!
Objective of the project:
1. Searches Indeed.com for roles you wish to apply (7 indeed pages per program run)
2. Saves the links to a CSV file
3. Checks whether each role includes the programming language/tools/technology you like
4. Checks whether each role has the definite no-no terms (like visa sponsorship, PR requirements, etc.)
5. Updates the saved CSV file to notify which roles you could apply

Things to do:
1. Search .py file for the term '#UPDATE REQUIRED'
2. Make necessary changes to the line following the term
